# ByteWatch-Code
=======
\### THIS IS THE DEV BRANCH \###\
If you want the full release, go [here](https://github.com/TheGreatPintoJ/DIYWatch-Code)

\### NOTHING IS GUARENTEED \###\
Everything in this branch is still under development and a work in progress, so nothing is guarenteed to work or be functional in any way.\
I will likely not respond or pay any attention to issues on this branch, so don't waste your time.
